# The UK Energy Market

Script:
Starting off with the basics, energy in the UK (and most countries) is produced and delivered to homes and businesses in alternating current. This means that the voltage goes up and down multiple times per second. In the UK this is between about -230 volts and +230 volts and back again, 50 times per second.

Now, a large number of generating sources are all connected to the UK energy grid, as are an even large number of energy consumers. Each has to be synchronised and produce power at this rate of 50 hertz.

Script:
If too much power goes into the system, then the frequency starts to rise, and if not enough goes in, then the frequency goes down. This is bad&mdash;not only because your devices you plug in at home expect 50 hertz and won't get the right amount of power, but because massive machines like power stations are designed to spin at a very specific frequency, and if you start spinning them at the wrong speed they will break, which creates a very expensive repair bill.

Script:
National Grid is the company responsible for making sure that this doesn't happen, by ensuring that the power being generated balances the power being used. This has got more difficult in recent years as more renewable energy has connected to the grid, because it is harder to predict when production will increase or decrease.
